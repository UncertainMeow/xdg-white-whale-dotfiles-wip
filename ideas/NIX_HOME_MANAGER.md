# Nix Home Manager - The Game Changer

## What Is Home Manager?

**Not NixOS** - It's a user-space package and configuration manager that runs on:
- macOS ✅
- Any Linux distro ✅  
- Even WSL ✅

Think of it as "Homebrew but reproducible and declarative."

## Why It's Perfect For You

### 1. Declarative Everything
Instead of "install this, configure that," you write:

```nix
# home.nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }: {
  home.packages = with pkgs; [
    git
    tmux  
    ripgrep
    fd
    bat
    eza
    starship
  ];

  programs.git = {
    enable = true;
    userName = "Kellen";
    userEmail = "your@email.com";
    extraConfig = {
      init.defaultBranch = "main";
      push.autoSetupRemote = true;
    };
  };

  programs.zsh = {
    enable = true;
    enableAutosuggestions = true;
    enableSyntaxHighlighting = true;
    
    # Your modular configs still work!
    initExtra = ''
      source ~/.config/zsh/functions.zsh
      source ~/.config/zsh/aliases.zsh
    '';
  };
}
```

### 2. Multi-Machine Magic
```nix
# Different configs per machine
if (config.networking.hostName == "work-laptop") then {
  home.packages = with pkgs; [ docker kubectl ];
} else {
  home.packages = with pkgs; [ games.steam ];
}
```

### 3. Rollback Superpowers
```bash
# Whoops, that broke something
home-manager switch --rollback

# Try a config change safely
home-manager switch --dry-run
```

### 4. Perfect Package Management
- **No more** "is this installed via homebrew or npm or cargo?"
- **Everything** declared in one place
- **Reproducible** across machines
- **Atomic** updates

## Integration Strategy

**Phase 1:** Keep your modular configs, add Home Manager for packages
**Phase 2:** Gradually move configurations into Home Manager
**Phase 3:** Pure declarative nirvana

You don't have to go all-in immediately!
