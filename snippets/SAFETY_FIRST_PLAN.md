# 🔐 SOPS/age Safety-First Implementation Plan

## 🎯 The Goal
Break through SOPS/age intimidation by building a **bulletproof, well-documented** secrets management system that integrates with your existing 1Password setup.

## 😰 Valid Fears & How We'll Address Them

### Fear #1: "Too many keys/tokens - I'll get confused"
**Solution:** We'll use exactly **ONE** age key pair, clearly documented, with multiple backups

### Fear #2: "I'll lock myself out of something important"  
**Solution:** Everything will have **multiple recovery paths** and **clear rollback procedures**

### Fear #3: "I'll mess up key management"
**Solution:** **Extensive error checking**, **validation scripts**, and **step-by-step verification** at every stage

## 🛡️ Safety Strategy

### Phase 1: Learning & Testing (NO REAL SECRETS)
1. Install tools and understand concepts
2. Create test keys and practice with dummy data
3. Verify we can encrypt/decrypt reliably
4. Document every step with clear explanations

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup (STILL NO REAL SECRETS)
1. Create proper key storage locations
2. Set up SOPS configuration files
3. Build validation and recovery scripts
4. Test all error scenarios

### Phase 3: Migration (ONE SECRET AT A TIME)
1. Start with non-critical test secret
2. Verify encryption/decryption works perfectly
3. Add real secrets incrementally
4. Each step has rollback documentation

## 🔑 Key Management Strategy

### The ONE Key Approach
```
We will have exactly ONE age key pair:
├── Private Key: ~/.config/age/keys.txt (primary location)
├── Backup 1: 1Password vault (secure note)
├── Backup 2: Encrypted USB drive (optional)
└── Public Key: In git repo (.sops.yaml)
```

### Clear Key Responsibilities
- **Private Key:** Decrypts secrets (NEVER goes in git)
- **Public Key:** Encrypts secrets (safe to put in git)
- **1Password:** Stores the private key as backup
- **SOPS:** Uses the keys to encrypt/decrypt files

## 📋 Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Tool Installation & Verification
```bash
brew install age sops
age --version    # Verify installation
sops --version   # Verify installation
```

### Step 2: Test Key Generation (PRACTICE ONLY)
```bash
# Generate test keys in a safe location
mkdir -p ~/test-age-practice
age-keygen -o ~/test-age-practice/test-key.txt
```

### Step 3: Practice Encryption/Decryption
```bash
# Practice with a test file
echo "This is a test secret" > ~/test-age-practice/test.txt
age -r $(cat ~/test-age-practice/test-key.txt.pub) \
    ~/test-age-practice/test.txt > ~/test-age-practice/test.txt.age
age -d -i ~/test-age-practice/test-key.txt \
    ~/test-age-practice/test.txt.age
```

### Step 4: Validation Scripts
We'll build scripts that verify:
- ✅ Keys exist and are readable
- ✅ Encryption/decryption works
- ✅ Backups are accessible
- ✅ SOPS configuration is valid

## 🚨 Error Checking at Every Step

### Before ANY Operation
1. **Verify key files exist and are readable**
2. **Test encryption/decryption with dummy data**
3. **Confirm backup locations are accessible**
4. **Validate SOPS configuration syntax**

### During Operations
1. **Immediate verification after each encrypt/decrypt**
2. **Checksum validation**
3. **Clear error messages with recovery instructions**

### After Operations
1. **Verify the operation actually worked**
2. **Test that secrets are still accessible**
3. **Update documentation with what was changed**

## 📚 Documentation Standards

### For Every Secret Added
```markdown
## Secret: API_KEY_NAME
- **Purpose:** What this key is for
- **Added:** Date and time
- **Location:** Path in encrypted file
- **Backup:** Where original is stored (1Password, etc.)
- **Recovery:** How to restore if lost
- **Last Tested:** When we last verified it works
```

### For Every Key Operation
```markdown
## Operation: Encrypt new secret
- **Date:** 2024-XX-XX
- **Files changed:** List of files
- **Verification:** How we confirmed it worked
- **Rollback:** How to undo if needed
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Before we move to real secrets, we must be able to:
1. ✅ Generate and backup keys reliably
2. ✅ Encrypt and decrypt test files perfectly
3. ✅ Recover from simulated key loss
4. ✅ Explain every step in simple terms
5. ✅ Roll back any changes cleanly

## 🔄 Recovery Planning

### If We Lose the Private Key
1. Retrieve backup from 1Password
2. Restore to ~/.config/age/keys.txt
3. Test with existing encrypted files
4. Document the recovery in our log

### If SOPS Config Gets Corrupted
1. Restore from git history
2. Validate configuration syntax
3. Test with existing encrypted files
4. Update documentation

### If We Get Confused
1. **STOP** - don't make changes when confused
2. Review documentation and verify understanding
3. Test with dummy data first
4. Ask questions before proceeding
